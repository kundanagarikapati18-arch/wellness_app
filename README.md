Wellness Wizard - Prototype
==========================

This is a prototype React app styled with Tailwind (CDN) to mimic a mobile wellness tracker UI.

How to run:
1. unzip and open in CodeSandbox (Upload ZIP), or
2. locally:
   - npm install
   - npm start

Notes:
- Tailwind is included via CDN in public/index.html for quick prototyping.
- The AI safety watcher is a simple keyword-based mock and runs locally in the browser.
- Replace memes and assets as needed.
